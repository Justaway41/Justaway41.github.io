                    The story is set in an alternate-history late-Edo period,
                    where humanity is attacked by aliens called "Amanto" (天人,
                    "Sky People"). Edo Japan's samurai fights to defend Earth,
                    but the shōgun cowardly surrenders when he realizes the
                    aliens' power. He agrees to an unequal contract with the
                    aliens, placing a ban on carrying swords in public and
                    allowing the invaders to enter the country. The samurai's
                    swords are confiscated and the Tokugawa bakufu (shogunate)
                    becomes a puppet government. The series focuses on an
                    eccentric samurai, Gintoki Sakata who works as an odd-jobs
                    freelancer. He helps a teenager named Shinpachi Shimura save
                    his sister Tae from an alien group that wants to send her to
                    a brothel. Impressed by Gintoki, Shinpachi becomes his
                    freelance apprentice to pay the bills and learn more about
                    the enigmatic samurai. When the pair rescues a teenage alien
                    girl with super-strength, Kagura, from a Yakuza group, they
                    accept her into their freelancing business and the three
                    become known as "Yorozuya" (万事屋, "We do everything" or
                    literally "The Anything Store"). While working, they
                    regularly encounter the Shinsengumi police force, who often
                    ally with Gintoki when work involves dangerous criminals.
                    The trio also meets Gintoki's former comrades from the
                    Amanto invasion, including the revolutionary Kotaro Katsura
                    who is friendly toward them despite his terrorist activities
                    against the alien-controlled government. Although the story
                    is mostly episodic, a few story arcs and recurring
                    antagonists develop.For example, Gintoki's former comrade
                    Shinsuke Takasugi is a major antagonist who regards Gintoki
                    and his other former comrades as enemies and seeks to
                    destroy the shogunate. Over time, Takasugi gains allies,
                    including Kagura's brother Kamui, and the elite fighting
                    unit Mimawarigumi to prepare for his large-scale coup
                    d'état. After the true antagonist—the immortal Utsuro—is
                    introduced, Gintoki works with both friends and enemies to
                    stop Utsuro from destroying the Earth.

                    any opponent with a single punch but seeks to find a worthy
                    opponent after growing bored by a lack of challenge due to
                    his overwhelming strength. ONE wrote the original webcomic
                    version in early 2009. A digital manga remake began
                    publication on Shueisha's Tonari no Young Jump website in
                    June 2012. The manga is illustrated by Yusuke Murata, and
                    its chapters are periodically compiled and published into
                    individual tankōbon volumes. As of January 2021, 23 volumes
                    have been released. In North America, Viz Media has licensed
                    the remake manga for English language release and was
                    serialized in its Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine. An
                    anime adaptation of the manga, produced by Madhouse, was
                    broadcast in Japan from October to December 2015. A second
                    season, produced by J.C.Staff, was broadcast from April to
                    July 2019. The anime series is licensed in North America by
                    Viz Media, and premiered in the United States on Adult
                    Swim's Toonami programming block in July 2016. The second
                    season premiered in October 2019. As of June 2012, the

                    Araki's JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga.Set in 2001, two
                    years after the events of Diamond is Unbreakable, Koichi
                    Hirose is sent to Italy and tasked by Jotaro Kujo to search
                    for Giorno Giovanna, an aspiring mafia gangster who is a son
                    of Dio Brando. But as Dio possessed the body of Jonathan
                    Joestar at time of his conception, Giorno is technically a
                    Joestar and takes more after them than the father he never
                    knew, despite his blond hair. The series follows Giorno as
                    he joins the mafia organization Passione, moving up through
                    its ranks with the intention of becoming its boss to improve
                    life in Italy. Through the series, it reveals that the Boss
                    has placed Bruno Bucciarati's group with his daughter, Trish
                    Una, so that he may kill her to protect his identity. After
                    Bucciarati suffers grievous injuries from the boss' King
                    Crimson, he, Giorno, and the majority of the gang find ways
                    of defeating the boss. They eventually find an ally named
                    Jean Pierre Polnareff, who helped in killing Giorno's father
                    13 years ago, eventually giving the gang a trump card, a
                    Stand Arrow. Giorno uses the stand arrow, defeats the boss,
                    and becomes the new boss of Passione, as seen in the finale.

                    drinking, partying, and stripping naked than actually
                    diving. Despite his attempts to distance himself from the
                    group, Iori gets quickly swept up in their antics, while his
                    cousins try to show him the wonders of diving into the ocean
                    and sea.

                    mysterious organization and solves a multitude of cases
                    while impersonating his childhood best friend's father and
                    other characters.The manga was adapted into an anime
                    television series by Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation and TMS
                    Entertainment, which premiered in January 1996. The anime
                    resulted in animated feature films, original video
                    animations, video games, audio disc releases and live action
                    episodes. Funimation licensed the anime series for North
                    American broadcast in 2003 under the name Case Closed with
                    the characters given Americanized names.

                    companies have developed various types of merchandising and
                    media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games.
                    The manga series was licensed for an English language

                    dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.The
                    series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man who, inspired
                    by his childhood idol and powerful pirate "Red Haired"
                    Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find
                    the titular treasure and proclaim himself the King of the
                    Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw
                    Hat Pirates,[Jp 1] Luffy rescues and befriends a swordsman
                    named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the One
                    Piece. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a navigator
                    and thief; Usopp, a sniper and a pathological liar; and
                    Vinsmoke Sanji, a perverted chef. They acquire a ship named
                    the Going Merry[Jp 2] and engage in confrontations with
                    notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew
                    set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in
                    the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, a doctor and
                    anthropomorphized reindeer; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and
                    former assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a
                    skeletal musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a fish-man
                    helmsman and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.
                    Once the Going Merry becomes damaged beyond repair, the
                    Straw Hat Pirates acquire a new ship named the Thousand
                    Sunny.[Jp 3] Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty
                    hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret
                    agents and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and
                    various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in
                    pursuit of their dreams.
